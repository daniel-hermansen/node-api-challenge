- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    Express can  build RESTful web services that are compatible with JSON.
    Express uses Middleware functions.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?
    Middleware is an array of functions that are executed in the order that they are written in the code.

- [ ] Describe a Resource?
    With a RESTful web API, everything is a resource. Every resource is accessible with a unique URI, though the resources can have multiple representations.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
    It can return a string along with the corresponding status code. 

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
    We can use Express routers.
